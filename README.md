# Incidence, prevalence and symptom burden of endometriosis in England: A population-based cohort study #

NICE Guidelines for hypertension medications
To define hypertension using prescriptions we used the guidelines available by NICE: **https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng136/resources/visual-summary-pdf-6899919517**

## Data source
These codelists were derived from the CPRD data dictionary, reported codes are in the form of SNOMED CT.
The data used for this analysis were derived from the records of people with an entry of ICD10 code N80 in HES.

CPRD: Clinical Practice Research Datalink. 
HES: Hospital Episode Statistics
HES APC: Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care

**Broad**
First record of N80 in either the first or second place of admission in HES APC (i.e. the cause of admission was endometriosis)
**Confirmed endometriosis**

## Definitions used to calculate prevalence
**HES**
Entry of N80 present in HES APC (irrespective of location in record)
**CPRD**

**CPRD or HES**
A combination of the above
